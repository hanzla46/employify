The body should be a short, friendly, and professional message referencing the job and the candidate's fit, ready to send as an initial contact or application email. Do not include placeholders or require further editing.

Why and What's Missing should be concise and specific to each job. Don't give explanations or additional text. Prefer phrases over sentences.

      - The cover letter should be addressed to the hiring manager of ${

      - Highlight how the applicant's skills and experiences from their profile summary align with the key requirements and responsibilities mentioned in the job description.
      - Maintain a professional and enthusiastic tone.
      - Ensure the letter expresses strong interest in the role and the company.
      - Conclude with a call to action, such as requesting an interview.
      - The letter should be well-structured with an introduction, body paragraphs (2-3), and a conclusion.
      - Do not include placeholders like "[Applicant's Name]" or "[Company Name]" unless it's for the salutation/closing where specific names are unknown. The content should be ready to use.
      - Focus on quality and relevance. Avoid generic statements.
      - Output only the cover letter text, without any introductory or concluding remarks from you (the AI). Start directly with the salutation (e.g., "Dear Hiring Team...").
